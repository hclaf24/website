      <p> &emsp; I am a junior computer science student at Texas A&M University. I acquired a minor in business from Auburn University through a study abroad program in Rome, Italy, and Madrid, Spain. At A&M I am minoring in New Media Art. In my minor, I am focusing on graphic design. I have recently found interest in user experience, specifically, web design. In my professional career, I hope to incorporate my interests in business, programming and graphic design.</p>
      <p> &emsp; I have been working to develop websites, and teach myself html, while I finish up my degree at A&M. In the next year before I graduate, I want to start my own design company. In addition to website design I want to provide app development as well as rebranding and graphic design. </p>
