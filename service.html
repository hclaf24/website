      <p>  &emsp; I volunteer with my sorority, Pi Beta Phi, through our Champions Are Readers program. In this program, I am assigned to a teacher at the local Bryan elementary schools. Each week I go to the teacher’s classroom and help them by reading with students.</p>
      <p> &emsp; I also worked with GirlStart, which is an amazing program that inspires young girls. The program is based around STEM education for K-12 girls which encourages them to pursue STEM through their electives, majors, and careers.</p>
      <p>  &emsp; I volunteered with the Austin Humane Society which is the largest no-kill, non-profit pet and adoption center in Austin. As a volunteer I walked dogs and played with them to give them time out of there kennels. I also helped clean up around the shelter and take care of the animals.</p>
