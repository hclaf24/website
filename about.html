      <p> &emsp; I was born and raised in Austin, Texas, and started to learn to program while in high school. I am now continuing my education as a student at the Texas A&M College of Engineering, studying Computer Science.</p>
      <p> &emsp; Growing up in Austin, where Lake Travis meets Lake Austin, I have fallen in love with wakeboarding, spending time on the lake, and hiking through the beautiful hill country. I also love Tex-Mex (especially queso), dogs, and beautiful sunsets. At school, in College Station, I spend my free time painting, exploring the town with my friends, and building. </p>
      <p> &emsp; This past summer, I studied abroad with the Auburn Harbert College of Business and received a minor in business. During the program, I attended classes in both Rome, Italy, and Madrid, Spain. While abroad, I had the opportunity to explore many cities throughout Italy, Spain, and France. From this fantastic experience, I gained many Auburn friends from all different places, and I will always cherish the incredible memories we made together from our exciting adventures abroad. </p>
