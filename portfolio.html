      <p> &emsp; I interned with the company Technology Kitchen in Austin, Texas, in the summer of 2017. I redesigned their website using WordPress and was giving the opportunity to redesign it again at the beginning of 2020. </p>

      <p> &emsp; My freshman year engineering project was to build a Lego machine that would sort marbles based on size and color. The machine also needed to have a barcode scanner that would read how many of each marble to dispense. If there were not enough of the specified marbles an alarm sounded to notify the user that the marbles would not be dispensed. </p>

      <p> &emsp; The following works are my favorite projects from Intro to Graphic Design, a course I took this past semester at A&M. This class was so much fun for me and I found I have a passion for graphic design. I hope to incorporate my love for design with my programming skills by focusing user experience and interaction.</p>
